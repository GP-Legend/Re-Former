# README

This application allows the user to create a User object complete with an email, username and password. To start the application, download the .zip file
and unpack it in your directory of choice. Navigate to the unpacked file in the Terminal/Command Line and run the command 'rails server'. Once the server is up, open up a web browser and type in the address 'localhost:3000/users/new' to begin creating new users. Use the address 'localhost:3000/users/[numerical ID of user/edit' to edit a user that already exists. The numerical ID in the address starts at 1, so if you have eight users and want to edit the seventh, all you have to do is type in the aforementioned address but replace the text in brackets with a 7.
